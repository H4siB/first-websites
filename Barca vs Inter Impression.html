<h2>Darmian: Inter played with heart in ‘crazy game’</h2>
<p>Inter are deserving winners of this game — and are deserving of their place in the final after a thrilling Champions League campaign.

That's the way substitute Matteo Darmian sees it anyway, as he chatted to Amazon Prime after that thrilling win.</p>

<p><b><i>“What a night, it was a crazy game,” he said. 
        <p>“We were 2-0 up and then they scored three times but we never give up. That's Inter, we play with heart and we won this game.</p>

            <p>“I don’t know why he was there (Acerbi) but he was in the right position in the perfect moment so we are very happy.</p>
    
            <p>“I have to be honest, <small>Barcelona</small> is a very good team. We played with heart and I think we deserved over the two legs to be in the final.</p>
    
        <p>“Now we will play the final, everyone wants to lift the trophy. We are there because of our performances and because we deserve to be there.”</p>
